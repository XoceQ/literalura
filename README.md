LiterAlura - Book Catalog 📚 

Description Welcome to my LiterAlura project! In this challenge, I built a book catalog by consuming the Gutendex API, which provides data for over 70,000 books from Project Gutenberg. This API gives me access to essential book details like titles, authors, languages, formats, and download counts. Best of all, it's free, easy to use, and doesn’t require an API key! 🚀

Tools and Technologies Used 🔧 Spring Boot: For building and running the backend application. PostgreSQL: To store book and author data. Gutendex API: For book and author data. JSON: To parse and manipulate API responses. 


Steps 📜 Java Environment Setup: I set up the JDK and configured my IDE (IntelliJ IDEA). Project Creation: Created a Java project and organized the folders. API Consumption: Learned how to consume the Gutendex API and parse the JSON responses. JSON Response Analysis: I analyzed the structure of the JSON response to extract necessary data. Database Insertion and Querying: I inserted data into PostgreSQL and created queries for specific books and authors. Displaying Results: I made sure to display the results to users in a clear, user-friendly format. 


Key Classes and Interfaces ⚙️ HttpClient: Handles HTTP requests to the book API. HttpRequest: Defines the structure for making requests. HttpResponse: Manages API responses, including error handling and data extraction. Scanner: I used it to read user input for queries. 



Implemented Functionalities 💡 Search Books: I can search for books by title using the Gutendex API and save selected books. Show Saved Books: Displays a list of books saved in the database. Delete Book: I can delete a book from the database by its ID. Show Authors by Book: Shows authors for a specific book based on its ID. Show All Authors: Lists all authors in the database. Show Books by Language: Displays the number of books available in different languages. Show Authors Alive in a Specific Year: Lists authors who were alive during a specific year. 

I'm excited to share this project with you! 😃📖
